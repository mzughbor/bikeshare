### Description
In this Git and GitHub Practice Project, we'll apply version control skills to refactor BikeShare project.
Here's a concise overview of the tasks we used:

- **Set Up:** Fork and clone a repository, add `bikeshare.py` file, data, and a `.gitignore`
- **Documentation:** Create a branch for documentation, enhance `README.md` and docstrings, and commit and push changes
- **Code Refactoring:** Create a refactoring branch, improve `bikeshare.py` code, commit iteratively, and work 
in parallel with the documentation branch
- **Merge:** Merge both branches into the master and push changes to the remote repository. Your submission
should include Git commands and a GitHub repository link
